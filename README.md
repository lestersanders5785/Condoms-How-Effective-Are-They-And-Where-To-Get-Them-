What Is A Condom? <br>
Condoms are tiny pockets that prevent sperm from entering the vagina. A condom is worn on the penis. Typically, latex, a form of rubber, is used to make it. However, some are made of substances like polyurethane or polyisoprene that are secure for those who have latex allergies. Male condoms are the most commonly used form of contraception. <br>

How Well Do Condoms Work To Prevent Pregnancy? <br>
Condoms are 98% efficient at preventing pregnancy if they are used correctly each and every time you have sex. Since people aren't perfect, condoms are only 85% effective in real life, which means that every year, 15 out of every 100 people who use condoms as their only form of birth control become pregnant. <br>

How Do Condoms Work? <br>
Condoms function by preventing semen, or fluid containing sperm, from entering the vagina. When the penis is erect, the male condom is worn on it. While gripping the condom's tip to create some additional space at the end, it is unrolled all the way to the base of the penis. This makes room for semen to collect after ejaculation and reduces the likelihood that the condom may rupture.<br>

The male should pull out of the vagina holding the condom at the base of the penis after ejaculating. He must perform this while the penis is still upright, to avoid spilling any semen onto the vagina. <br>

Where Can I Find Condoms? <br>
One of the best things about condoms is how widely available they are, making them highly practical and simple to obtain. <br>

Condoms are available at pharmacies, community health centers, doctors' offices, supermarkets, convenience stores, online retailers, and even vending machines. Anyone may purchase condoms; a prescription is not required, and there are no age limitations.<br>

Some individuals find it somewhat unpleasant to purchase condoms in a store, and for this, the U.K. government has developed an app called the eC-Card app.<br>

The eC-Card app is a free condom application that allows users to access free contraception from participating pharmacies near them. <br>

According to studies, providing free condoms to teenagers does not encourage them to engage in more sexual activity but does encourage those who are already engaged in it to use condoms more consistently. One effective strategy to minimize pregnancy and STD rates among sexually active young people in the UK is to increase access to condoms through the eC-Card app.<br>
All users have to do is register onto the platform with their mobile numbers and pin code. The app does not require any personal information like the user’s name to operate.<br>

After registering, the user will be asked to watch three short videos on the free condom application on various topics like how to use a condom and its importance; after which they will be guided to the closest pickup point. The user can collect free condoms by just scanning a QR code at the pickup point. No interaction is required. <br>

Benefits Of Giving Condoms Without Charge<br>
In reducing the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), condoms have a demonstrated positive impact on public health. <br>

Places offering free condoms observed:<br>

•	More people acquiring, using, and carrying condoms<br>
•	younger people are delaying or abstaining from sexual activity more<br>
•	Lower rates of HIV infection, which reduces the cost of healthcare<br>
•	Less HIV and STD risk among sex workers and groups where STD incidence is higher<br>

To make sure your condoms are in good condition, try the following:<br>

•	Keep your condoms in a dry, cool environment. Keeping them in your wallet causes heat and friction, which might damage them.<br>
•	Condoms are durable yet they do not endure forever. Before using one, make sure to check the expiration date.<br>
•	Check the package for a small air bubble before opening it. That will confirm that the package doesn't have a hole in it (or the condom).<br>
•	To avoid tearing or breaking the condom when opening the packet, carefully rip along the far side. If you do tear it, get a new one right away.<br>
